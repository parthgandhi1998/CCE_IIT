1. Arrange the ‘Orders’ dataset in decreasing order of amount

SELECT *
FROM Orders
ORDER BY amount DESC;


2. Create a table with name ‘Employee_details1’ and comprising of these columns – ‘Emp_id’,
‘Emp_name’, ‘Emp_salary’. Create another table with name ‘Employee_details2’, which
comprises of same columns as first table.

CREATE TABLE Employee_details1 (
    Emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    Emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee_details2 (
    Emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    Emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);


3. Apply the union operator on these two tables

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details1

UNION

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details2;


4. Apply the intersect operator on these two tables

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details1

INTERSECT

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details2;


5. Apply the except operator on these two tables

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details1

EXCEPT

SELECT *
FROM Employee_details2;
