1. Use the inbuilt functions and find the minimum, maximum and average amount from the orders
table

-- Minimum amount
SELECT MIN(amount) AS min_amount
FROM Orders;

-- Maximum amount
SELECT MAX(amount) AS max_amount
FROM Orders;

-- Average amount
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_amount
FROM Orders;


2. Create a user-defined function, which will multiply the given number with 10

CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyByTen(@number INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN @number * 10;
END;


3. Use the case statement to check if 100 is less than 200, greater than 200 or equal to 200 and
print the corresponding value

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN 100 < 200 THEN 'Less than 200'
        WHEN 100 > 200 THEN 'Greater than 200'
        ELSE 'Equal to 200'
    END AS result;
