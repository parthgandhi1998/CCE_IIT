1. Create an ‘Orders’ table which comprises of these columns – ‘order_id’, ‘order_date’, ‘amount’,
‘customer_id’

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
);


2. Make an inner join on ‘Customer’ & ‘Order’ tables on the ‘customer_id’ column

SELECT *
FROM customer
INNER JOIN Orders
ON customer.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;


3. Make left and right joins on ‘Customer’ & ‘Order’ tables on the ‘customer_id’ column

-- Left join
SELECT *
FROM customer
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON customer.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;

-- Right join
SELECT *
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN customer
ON Orders.customer_id = customer.customer_id;


4. Update the ‘Orders’ table, set the amount to be 100 where ‘customer_id’ is 3

UPDATE Orders
SET amount = 100
WHERE customer_id = 3;
